How are you today?
What is the weather today?
I haven't seen that.
But I asked you first.
How do you mean?
That's good. Heads are useful.
Sure, go ahead.
What is your favorite animal?
I don't know. What do you like to do?
Do you think by yourself?
You're welcome. What do you do for fun?
Why?
What are you doing today?
So, what do you like to do?
I'm fine, thank you.
Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince.
